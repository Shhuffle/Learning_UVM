Two sets of precedence rules apply to uvm_config_db. Firstly, during the build phase a set() call in a context higher 
up the component hierarchy takes precedence over a set() call occurring lower down the hierarchy. Secondly, in case 
of identical contexts or after the build phase, the last set() call takes precedence over the earlier one. For more details 
on these rules, please consult the UVM reference manual or look directly at the verbosity messages from the UVM 
code.
