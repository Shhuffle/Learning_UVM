The uvm_config_db class is the recommended way to access the resource database.
A resource is any piece of information that is shared between two or more components
or objects. We use uvm_config_db::set to put information into the database and use uvm_config_db::get to retrieve information from the database. 

The type parameter has no limitation it can a class, a uvm_object, a build-in type like a bit, byte or a virtual interface, etc

There are two typical uses of the uvm_config_db. The first is to pass virtual interfaces from the HDL/DUT domain 
to the test, and the second is to pass configuration objects down through the testbench hierarchy.
