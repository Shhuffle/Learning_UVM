SystemVerilog Packages & UVM Guidelines
Package = groups related declarations (types, constants, funcs, classes) into a namespace for organization & reuse. Must be imported before use.
UVM base library = in uvm_pkg. UVM testbenches use packages to organize agents, envs, sequences, tests.

Guidelines

1.Naming
Package name ends with _pkg.
File name matches package, extension .sv.
Example: spi_env_pkg.sv â†’ package spi_env_pkg;.

2.Classes
Each class in separate .svh file.
Only the package file uses `include (no includes inside .svh).
Include files in correct compile order.

3.Imports
External package imports at top of package body.
No imports inside .svh files.

4.Directory Structure
Keep all package files in one directory.
Ensures reuse, clean compilation, standalone agent packages.

External imports are available for that package only i.e if we include a package
inside another package then only the include local to the first package will be included
in the second package, no external package can be loaded in the second package.
