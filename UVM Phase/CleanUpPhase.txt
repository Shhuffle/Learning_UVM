Clean Up Phases 
The clean up phases are used to extract information from scoreboards and functional coverage monitors to determine 
whether the test case has passed and/or reached its coverage goals. The clean up phases are implemented as functions 
and therefore take zero time to execute. They work from the bottom to the top of the component hierarchy. 

extract 
The extract phase is used to retrieve and process information from scoreboards and functional coverage monitors. 
This may include the calculation of statistical information used by the report phase. This phase is usually used by 
analysis components. 

check 
The check phase is used to check that the DUT behaved correctly and to identify any errors that may have occurred 
during the execution of the testbench. This phase is usually used by analysis components. 

report 
The report phase is used to display the results of the simulation or to write the results to file. This phase is usually 
used by analysis components. 

final 
The final phase is used to complete any other outstanding actions that the testbench has not already completed.
