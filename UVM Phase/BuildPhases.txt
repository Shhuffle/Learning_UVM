Build Phases 
The build phases are executed at the start of the UVM testbench simulation and their overall purpose is to construct, 
configure and connect the testbench component hierarchy. 
All the build phase methods are functions and therefore execute in zero simulation time. 

build 
Once the UVM testbench root node component is constructed, the build phase starts to execute. It constructs the 
testbench component hierarchy from the top downwards. The construction of each component is deferred so that 
each layer in the component hierarchy can be configured by the level above. During the build phase 
uvm_components are indirectly constructed using the UVM factory. 


connect 
The connect phase is used to make TLM connections between components or to assign handles to testbench 
resources. It has to occur after the build method has put the testbench component hierarchy in place and works from 
the bottom of the hierarchy upwards. 

end_of_elaboration 
The end_of_elaboration phase is used to make any final adjustments to the structure, configuration or connectivity of 
the testbench before simulation starts. Its implementation can assume that the testbench component hierarchy and 
inter-connectivity is in place. This phase executes bottom up.
