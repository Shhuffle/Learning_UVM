The Agent Connect phase
Once the agent's sub-components have been constructed, they must be connected. 
The usual agent connetions required are 
    Monitor's analysis port to agent's analysis port
    Sequencer's seq_item_pull_export to driver's seq_item_pull_port (for active agent only)
 • Analysis sub-component's analysis export to monitor's analysis port (where analysis sub-components exist)
 • Monitor/driver's proxy virtual interface to configuration object's monitor/driver BFM virtual interface 2


 Notes:
 1. The agent's analysis port handle can be assigned a pointer from the monitor's analysis port. This saves having to
 construct a separate analysis port object in the agent.
 2.Assigning the driver proxy and monitor proxy virtual interfaces in the agent removes the need for these
 sub-components to have the overhead of a configuration table lookup.
