The UVM stimulus generation process is based on sequences controlling the behavior of drivers by generating 
sequence_items and sending them to the driver via a sequencer. 

The content of the sequence_item is closely related to the needs of the driver. The driver relies on the content of the 
sequence_items it receives to determine which type of pin level transaction to execute. The sequence items property 
members will consist of data fields that represent the following types of information: 
• Control - i.e. What type of transfer, what size 
• Payload - i.e. The main data content of the transfer 
• Configuration - i.e. Setting up a new mode of operation, error behavior etc 
• Analysis - i.e. Convenience fields which aid analysis - time stamps, rolling checksums etc 

Randomization Considerations 
Sequence_items are randomized within sequences to generate traffic data objects. Therefore, stimulus data properties 
should generally be declared as rand, and the sequence_item should contain any constraints required to ensure that 
the values generated by default are legal, or are within sensible bounds. In a sequence, sequence_items are often 
randomized using in-line constraints which extend these base level constraints.
